# ORAMMA
**O**bject **R**ecognition, **A**ttention, **M**emory with **MA**tlab (**ORAMMA** experiments). 

A collection of behavioural experiments programmed with Matlab.

## Experimental Tasks:
* Reaction Times task (Object Recognition)
* Attentional Blink task (Conscious access)
* Attentional Capture task (Selective Attention)
* Additional Singleton task (Selective Attention)
* Duration Discrimination (Time Perception)
* Posner Cuing task (Selective Attention)
* Discriminability task (Object Recognition)
* Episodic Memory task (Long-term Memory)
* Semantic memory task (Long-term Memory)
* Working Memory task
* Passive Viewing task
* Visual Search task
* Change Blindness task
* Working Memory task
* N-back task

## Task Numbers:
Task numbers are defined in the main script of each task (e.g. the task number of the attentional blink task is defined in the script ***main_abVn.m***, where **n** is the version number). 

**Task numbers given so far:**

* **1** for the reaction times task (version 1)
* **2** for the attentional blink task (version 1)
* **3** for the passive viewing task
* **4** for the posner cuing task
* **5** for the attentional capture task (version 1)
* **6** for the additional singleton task (version 1)

## Completed tasks so far:
* Reaction times task (simple version without masking)
* Attentional blink task (simple version with digits and letters)
* Passive viewing task 
* Posner cuing task (simple version adapted from Posner, 1980)
* Additional singleton task (simple version adapted from Theeuwes, 1992)
* Attentional capture task (version with faces and houses as stimuli)

## Coming soon
* Documentation of the completed tasks  
* Instructions on how to run a task
* Duration discrimination task
* N-back task
